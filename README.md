Amazon Web Services Scripts and Tests

I am going to put bits of code (mainly written in Python) that can be used to work with the AWS infrastructure. 

I will make liberal use of the free tier that AWS provides new accounts. However, if testing can be done quickly, some examples may include some "larger" EC2 instances. 

The goal is to create, deploy, and be able to scale, a web application in a cost effective manner. 
Time is of the essence.
